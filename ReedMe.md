Sure! Let’s break down each of the 28 Tailwind CSS steps with **detailed definitions**. Each step represents a category of utility classes, and these definitions will help you understand what each set of classes does and how they are applied.

### 1. **Layout**
Classes under layout control how elements are positioned and arranged in a container.
- `flex`: Turns an element into a flex container, allowing the child elements (flex items) to be positioned using flexbox rules.
- `grid`: Turns an element into a grid container, allowing child elements to be arranged in rows and columns.
- `block`: Displays an element as a block-level element, taking up the full width of its parent container.
- `inline-block`: Makes an element behave like an inline element but still allows setting width and height.
- `hidden`: Completely hides an element from view, removing it from the layout.

### 2. **Spacing**
These classes control the space inside (padding) or outside (margin) an element.
- `p-4`: Applies padding of 1rem (16px) on all four sides of the element.
- `m-2`: Adds margin of 0.5rem (8px) on all sides of the element.
- `mt-6`: Adds margin-top of 1.5rem (24px).
